Yes, this is a botnet command-and-control server.

Some people are so nice they donate their spare machines' resources to my
research efforts. To make it as easy as possible for them, I'm making a
custom Ubuntu ISO that they can just boot and then their machine is mine.


#### Is this malware? Can I safely clone this?

I don't consider it malware, and I think it does comply with the GitHub rules.
[See my reasons here.](https://github.com/github/site-policy/issues/1033)


#### Can I use this myself?

If you use this to run your own botnet, please make very sure your donors
understand what they're agreeing to, and you have all necessary legal and
moral permissions.
